This library is for internal Google use only. It contains core components of `FirebaseAppCheck`,
from the [`firebase-ios-sdk`](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) project, for use in
other Google SDKs. External developers should integrate directly with the
[Firebase App Check SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check).
